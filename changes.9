Backlog of Hardcode Changes in TinyMARE v1.0.10215-v1.0.10316, Winds Year 0013.

----June 11, 2004
 1. Fixed a parser problem when the [ character is part of an escape sequence.
 2. Spaces are now allowed between commas in an $event or @event command.
----June 12, 2004
 1. Fixed a bug where increasing Maximum HP/MP/EN did not reduce the current
     HP/MP/EN to 100% when the timer ran out.
 2. @hlock'd players now announce levelups to other players in their location
     regardless.
 3. For races or guilds with spaces in their name, you can now use the +com
     system by substiuting those spaces with _ characters for the channel name.
     Channel names are still limited to 15 letters total, including the $ or %.
 4. Combat skills Leftwield, Barefist, and Ambidexterity no longer increase in
     level if the attack did not deliver any damage.
 5. Renamed $techbase to $train, which contains the # points needed for 1%
     Skill or SPLV 1 when TRAIN_SPELLS is turned on.
 6. Removed the $techraise attribute.
 7. The $techlevel attribute can now parse functions like $cost and $chantrate.
 8. Looking at a combat item no longer strips ANSI color from its $desc.
 9. Setting EXP_SYSTEM to 2 now removes the 'For Next' entry in the status and
     replaces the Next field in the +sbar with Impact %.
10. The @treasure attribute now allows a "Parent=#dbref" field which sets a new
     treasure parent on a per-enemy basis.
11. Added attributes @fsearch and @ofsearch to display user-defined messages
     for a room or object when 'search' fails (due to @lsearch being set or no
     treasure was found in the room).
12. The @comtitle attribute now parses %0 as the current channel name.
13. When specifying a time format string with @destroy or time(), months or
     days must now be specified using their full name or 3-letter abbreviation.
14. Installed the new TinyMare v3.0 Food Timer System. It is enabled only if
     FOOD_TIMER is set to 1. With this change, a new column is added to the
     etc/sector.db file called Food, which determines the rate of consumption
     per minute and per room moved. Players may idle or chat in town areas
     without worry of losing food as long as they don't move through rooms.
15. Implemented the Sunlight condition for races, such as Ents, who can produce
     their own food outdoors.
16. Added new spell attributes $eat and $oeat, which display custom messages
     when players eat food items.
----June 13, 2004
 1. The current spell level while parsing attributes or executing spells can
     now be retrieved using v(splv). Note that this is the only special
     variable that works like this.
 2. Commands $cost, $chantrate, and $techlevel no longer parse %0 as the
     current spell level. Use [v(splv)] instead.
 3. $desc and $caption now parse %0 as the spell number being examined, instead
     of the current spell level.
 4. Added the @comlock command to restrict channels to specific player
     characters in the game. Also added accompanying '@list comlocks' entry.
----June 15, 2004
 1. The @treasure attribute now allows a "Rate=<Value>", where <Value> is from
     0 to 1000. This value provides a fixed percentage treasure rate, which
     would otherwise depend on a player's vs. enemy's level.
 2. Fixed treasure rates now appear in an enemy's status screen.
 3. Removed the TreasureRate combat bitmap, since it is now unnecessary.
----June 17, 2004
 1. @init now sets a player's @pennies to START_BONUS, or an object's @pennies
     to 0.
----June 21, 2004
 1. Fixed a goof-up in @encounters where Rate= accidentally set the number of
     groups instead of the actual rate.
----June 23, 2004
 1. When displaying a "%U has defeated %N!" message, listeners now see %# as
     the correct killer.
----June 27, 2004
 1. Added additional #-1 checks when matching if an object can locate another
     using the loc() function.
----August 31, 2004
 1. Fixed a crash bug in selecting a combat target when using an item that
     checks for only-living or only-wounded enemies and you're currently not
     fighting anything.
----September 19, 2004
 1. Fixed some warning messages about unsigned/signed types in db/convert.c.
----September 23, 2004
 1. Added a second argument to the cond() function, which enables someone with
     POW_COMBAT to list all conditions of a particular type: cond(player,type).
     Types are the basic Condition types, currently: Status, Protect, Attack,
     Remedy, Element, Reflect, and Fatal. Note that while the default is
     "Status", specifying the type lists all Status conditions including Wish,
     Racial, and temporary battle changes.
 2. Added a new game configuration variable, FOOD_EFFECTS, which allows for
     several effects if FOOD_TIMER is nonzero. Add +1 to FOOD_EFFECTS to enable
     changes to physical attack damage if food is too low or too high. Add +2
     to FOOD_EFFECTS to enable changes to regeneration rate if too low or high
     (-1 or +1 respectively).
 3. The Flying condition can no longer avoid attacks when an enemy is indoors,
     even if still shown as (Flying). Flying still allows enemies to avoid
     being hindered by deep water when indoors.
----November 10, 2004
 1. Added new function localize(arg), which parses an argument much like s(),
     except that all environment variables that were modified during the
     parsing are restored to their original values when localize() finishes.
 2. Added function localize_as(arg,cause,executor), which operates identical to
     s_as(), except that all environment variables are restored like with
     localize().
----January 8, 2005
 1. Added game configuration variables MAXHP_REGEN_DISIVOR, MAXMP_REGEN_DIVISOR
     and MAXEN_REGEN_DIVISOR, to control the rate of regeneration of lost
     HP/MP/EN. These values default to 0.
 2. Renamed $uncurse to $transmute and changed its syntax. $transmute set to
     -1 will destroy the object when an effect occurs, and 0 will now preserve
     the object.
 3. Added Helptext for Draw Points and associated events and attributes.
 4. Renamed $minmana to $manasurge and $manafloor to $minmana.
 5. Implemented auto-regeneration ($manaregen) for touchstones and draw-point
     rooms.
 6. Implemented spoilage for food items over time.
 7. Changed the default rates of food spoilage across the different sectors.
 8. Added the Drawpoint room condition, to keep track of a room's current mana
     level.
----January 9, 2005
 1. Added game configuration variables DRAW_SYSTEM and DRAW_DAMAGE to facilite
     the new Draw Points system.
 2. Added the 'draw' command.
 3. Developed the base code to implement actions other than Fight in the
     combat queue. This can later be used to allow equipping of items during
     battles, watch enemies, or block and parry attacks.
 4. Added the 'Touchstone' item $type. Touchstones have the added benefit of
     allowing players to draw magic from them while in one's inventory, rather
     than requiring it to be equipped.
----February 1, 2005
 1. Added new combat item variable $forgeinfo, which is a strictly user-
     defined string that can be set on any item.
----April 3, 2005
 1. Fixed a bug where being killed indirectly (such as being Poisoned) by an
     enemy set Boss crashed the game.
----May 26, 2005
 1. Function waittime(player,id) now returns "#-1 No such ID." if <id> does not
     exist in <player>'s wait queue (even if it exists in the command queue).
 2. Added +config Metric for switching between kilograms and pounds in weight
     measurements.
----May 28, 2005
 1. Fixed a crash bug while copying techniques if the destination object had no
     prior technique slots filled.
 2. Fixed a bug with remove_conditions() and remove_stat_mods() zeroing out
     techniques on players when the game is compiled using GCC 4.0.

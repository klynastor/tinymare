Object Database Flag List.  Last updated April 10, 2004.  - Gandalf
_______________________________________________________________________________

Terms:
  Bit = Least significant bit from the right.
	Ex. 0=0x1, 1=0x2, 2=0x4, 3=0x8, 4=0x10, ..., 31=0x8000_0000

 Type = One or 'Any' of 8 object types (listed below).

	A bit can hold multiple flags if each flag corresponds to a different
	object type. The object type must also be checked to know if the flag
	is really set. This allows more than 32 flags in a 32-bit area.

 Name = The name of the flag.

	Each flag has a unique, case-sensitive letter used for matching. This
	allots for 52 flags: A-Z and a-z. By tradition, only two flag names
	begin with the same letter of the alphabet.
	
	In our representation, flags that begin with an uppercase letter refer
	to the A-Z list, and those that begin with a lowercase refer to a-z.

_______________________________________________________________________________

Object Types:  Object types take up the first 3 bits of the flag list, and can
-------------  hold values from 0 to 7:

  0   Room		A room containing players, things, and exits.
  1   Thing		Things can be taken, dropped, or moved between rooms.
  2   Exit		Links rooms together so that players can walk around.
  3   Player		Those who play the game and interact with the objects.
  4   Zone		Contains a group of rooms that belong to the same area.
  5   (Reserved)	Reserved for future use.
  6   (Reserved)	Reserved for future use.
  7   Garbage		A destroyed database object waiting to be recycled.

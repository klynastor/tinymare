The air is cold. Vapors of mist encircle your spirit in every direction, as
you gently glide through the ether. You have been on a long, quiet journey,
slowly traveling through time, since the death of your mortal body. Your soul
grows weak with hunger, and your essence grows weary with eternity. Yet your
spirit lives on, floating endlessly through the grey world that follows death.

It has been one thousand years since you have seen your last sunrise, eaten
your last meal, and spoken your last words. But on this very special hour,
this brief moment in the dimension of time, a speckle of light shines in the
distance. Small this light was at first, but large it slowly grew. Your soul
was saved, by the slightest of all odds. Your destiny was written. Your story--
to be lived.

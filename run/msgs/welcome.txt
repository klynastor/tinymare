Welcome to WindsMARE, a Multi-User Adventure Role-Playing Game.  With features
that rival not only other text-based games, but also many video games, Winds is
popular with its hundreds of users.  Because many people can access at once,
there is a social aspect of the game unencountered by those who are accustomed
to playing video-based RPGs.  Our plan is to be able to preserve this unique
difference and to keep WindsMARE a positive experience for everyone.

Several administrators have offered their time and resources to help maintain
and regulate WindsMARE.  Although the administration tries to keep behavior and
conduct suitable for all ages and ethnic backgrounds, we cannot regulate all
the text that others say online.  Harassment of any kind is not tolerated, and
players are encouraged to talk with an administrator if they are a victim of
such an occurrence.

WindsMARE is provided to the public at no cost or obligation for your
enjoyment.  In doing so, though, it is necessary to keep an atmosphere where
people of all ages and cultures can interact and feel accepted.  Granted, there
is no solution to every problem that can arise, but most can be solved quickly
and justly as long as the rights of others are respected.

# run/etc/services - Supported Services
#
# This file holds a list of passwords used by several services that you wish
# to allow access to your site. Currently supported are three services:
#
#  conc - Concentrator service for binding multiple character logins through
#         a remote host/port using only one file descriptor, allowing TinyMare
#         to support more users online than the maximum number of files that
#         can be open at once (shown using +info cpu).
#
#  rwho - TinyMare's own Remote-Who service, which idles in the background
#         waiting for players to type in commands that accept user@mudname as
#         an argument. This gives players the ability to send pages, mail, or
#         wholist requests to any other Mare site running on the internet.
#
#  smtp - Simple Mail Telnet Protocol support allows TinyMare to act as an
#         E-mail delivering agent to players' accounts from the internet.
#         Localhost must have an appropriate configuration file set in
#         /etc/sendmail.cf for redirection (see lib/smtp/Readme for details).
#
# Each uncommented line contains three words separated by whitespace indicating
# the service, origin ip address, and password respectively. With this setup,
# each individual service and remote host can have a different password for
# maximum security. A password need not be supplied.  Example of an entry:
#
# conc	127.0.0.1		password

# End of services.

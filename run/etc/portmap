# run/etc/portmap - Available Ports
#
# This file holds a list of ports that are automatically turned on when the
# program finds and loads the database. Currently supported are the following:
#
#   game - Default login screen where anyone can connect to the game.
#
#  admin - Separate port allowing only administration to connect through.
#
#   http - Supports HTML 1.0 requests.
#
#   mesg - Prints a message at login and disconnects user.
#
# Each uncommented line contains two words separated by whitespace indicating
# a service specifier and a port number. Services can be any of three types
# (listed above) that determine how new connections to the port should behave.
# The port number is any number from 1024 to 9999 (or 1 to 1023 if running the
# server as root). If the port number contains the word 'default', then the
# configured variable TINYPORT is to be used. If no entry below contains the
# default port, then it will default to 'game'.  Example entries:
#
# game		default
# admin		23
# http		7350
# mesg		6666	msgs/noentry.txt

# End of portmap.

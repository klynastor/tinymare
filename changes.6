A Backlog of Hardcode Changes in TinyMARE v1.0.7880-v1.0.8816, Winds Year 0010.

----May 25, 2001
 1. Fixed a bug in deleting equipment from a player's inventory corrupting the
     item list.
 2. Rewrote the run_fight_queue() processing routine with support for multi-
     event and multi-attack spells, as well as regeneration intervals of 100ms.
     Each spell can have multiple events, which can have multiple attacks, each
     with an associated left- and right-hand attack.
----May 26, 2001
 1. Reconfigured Area Attack types to include two new groups: Domain and
     Global. Domain targets all players and monsters in the caster's sector,
     and Global targets all players currently logged into the game.
 2. Rewrote the targetting subsystem. It is now possible for players to omit
     the targets in spells such as 'Refresh' and 'Blaze', and the correct
     target (the player versus his opponent) will be automatically selected.
 3. "Object-type" targetting is now determined via Player or Nonplayer objects
     in the room. An object set with the new 'Familiar' condition will behave
     like a Player rather than a Nonplayer. Such objects can now belong to a
     player's +party for battle purposes, but will not receive any experience.
 4. A new "Multi" area attack type allows the player to choose the range for
     the spell. Specifying an object name as the target will only hit a single
     target, however prefixing that name with a * will hit the target's group.
     The special keyword 'All' can be used to select all opponents for an
     attack spell, or all allies for a curative spell automatically.
----May 27, 2001
 1. Added support for the Psyched condition to random_enemy(). Psyched players
     by definition will attack other players until not one ally is remaining.
 2. Wrote tracking information into the fight queue to track what stage, attack
     number, and left-handed count currently belongs to the attacker while
     going through the event list on a spell. Also required was the ability to
     preserve the target selected during subsequent attacks, as well as that
     target's Area-Attack Range.
 3. Coded a plug-in for the future Artificial Intelligence system. This allows
     the AI Engine to preselect the desired target (in addition to spell cast)
     at the beginning of the round instead of at spell execution time.
 4. Added the 'Reverse' flag to a Tactics entry. Enemies using these techniques
     will cast them on opponents if curative, and on themselves if offensive.
 5. Added the @copyspell command to make it easier to test variants of spells.
 6. The 'Stop' flag on individual events now shows up as a red X while
     examining spells.
----May 28, 2001
 1. Added 'Fight', 'Nearfatal', 'Condition', and 'Round' tactics types to the
     routine that preselects spells for enemies at the beginning of a round.
 2. Rewrote the displaying of spell $captions. Captions now allow 4 environment
     variables: %0=Spell Level, %1=Attack Power, %2=Defense Power, and %3=
     Spell Duration. Some variables can be blank depending on the first event
     in the spell.
----May 31, 2001
 1. Added a new function to show the $message and $cast attributes on spells
     during the battle. Such messages can now be customized per enemy and per
     spell using user-defined attributes on the enemy. The attributes take the
     form of one letter plus a number or the + symbol. The letter corresponds
     to the type of action-message to be displayed. More information is found
     in the 'Spell Messages' help page.
----June 6, 2001
 1. Added the cond() and econd() functions to the Attack Event damage equation.
----June 7, 2001
 1. Fixed a bug in @deltech that prevented monster data from being removed.
----June 9, 2001
 1. Removed the first unnecessary argument to the softcode function spattr().
 2. Added the 'cast' command and reworked 'use' to use equipped items and
     skilled techniques as opposed to regular items. Also, equipped items will
     only get used if inventory items are first depleted.
 3. @list spells now accepts a numerical range (xx-yy).
 4. Added the bitmap variable Skill Rate to gauge the speed of performing
     techniques on players and monsters.
 5. Added a new 'status' screen for monsters.
----June 10, 2001
 1. Added a new soul() softcode function to return the value of combat status
     variables on players and monsters.
 2. Added three new Attack event options: Oneself, Nomiss, and Natural.
 3. Fixed problems with Levelquests that are not completable (story bit is 0).
 4. Fixed a bug with 'whisper' spamming other players in the room.
 5. Fixed a bug with multi-stage spells consuming MP/EN at every stage.
----June 11, 2001
 1. Only spells with a nonzero MP cost will now be affected by Runic condition.
----June 19, 2001
 1. Released version 1.6.2 of the WindsMARE font, which adds support for
     Adobe .pcf font files used in X-Windows on UNIX. Likewise, removed the
     mare/lib/fonts directory from the standard source tree.
----June 24, 2001
 1. Readded the item type "Wish" (084).
 2. Moved the trigger for an enemy Escape in front of normal tactics selection.
----June 29, 2001
 1. Rewrote targetting to support 5 different types of objects as defined on
     the spell's Area Attack flags.
 2. Using items now depletes from a player's inventory before checking equipped
     items. Putting items into equipped containers makes them available for
     instantaneous use during battle.
 3. You can now 'use' equipped items, items in containers, and skilled techs.
 4. New experience awarding system. Experience is given to players in parties
     within 5 rooms of the attacker. When fighting a boss, all players in the
     boss room will receive the EXP. Everyone will share the EXP gained, but
     the victor will reap the remainder.
----July 7, 2001
 1. Integrated a new version of Ultra-Fast-Crypt (UFC) into the distribution.
     Because it is faster than GLIBC's, TinyMARE uses this exclusively.
 2. The watchdog 'wd' program is no longer used by default.
 3. Moved around the Monster Settings bitmaps again, as well as readded Torch
     counts and extra reserved space for future combat settings on players.
----July 8, 2001
 1. Implemented the MD5 Hashing algorithm into the UFC-crypt library.
 2. New feature: Setting yourself Puppet will turn off the ability to see Dark
     objects that you own in the room. This is useful for builders to see what
     their room would look like if a normal player was to visit.
 3. Optimized loading the database in the case that the number of powers
     defined between both database versions is different.
 4. The '@crash' and '@reboot restart' commands no longer rely on Watchdog.
----July 13, 2001
 1. Fixed a display error on the '+info cpu' screen when malloc-info isn't
     available for a particular operating system.
 2. Fixed a pointer check bug in the DOTECHLIST macro. The macro now sets the
     pointer to NULL after it has exhausted the linked list.
----July 14, 2001
 1. Fixed tactics to check for quantities of inventory items before trying to
     use them in combat.
----July 15, 2001
 1. Players with the Puppet flag set no longer see dbref#s for objects they
     control during a 'look'. Even more useful for testing how a room looks to
     other players. Note objects with special flags will still show the dbref#.
----July 16, 2001
 1. Changed the error message on @empower to further describe why a player
     could not be given an appropriate power.
----July 20, 2001
 1. Apostrophes are now allowed in playernames.
----July 21, 2001
 1. Objects can now have aliases. When targetting an object in the room, the
     object's full alias needs to be typed (no abbreviations).
 2. Major bug fix: @delparenting objects with descendants was not correctly
     removing the attributes on the object's children.
 3. Made some optimizations to the unparse_object() function, including a
     cyclic buffer for multiple calls.
 4. Fixed a coloring error in the >- while casting rainbow techniques.
 5. Reduced the number of malloc()s called when storing user-defined attrs.
----August 1, 2001
 1. TinyMARE Version 1.0.8005 released.
 2. Fixed a sign error in the 64-bit DES crypt and turned on 64-bit encryption
     for Alpha processors.
----August 4, 2001
 1. Added support for large numbers of players logged in (over 1024) by adding
     a dynamically reallocable fd_set structure.
----August 8, 2001
 1. Fixed a bug in +com where the comtitle wouldn't show up when the message
     began with a ' character.
 2. New algorithm for searching database object parent trees. Uses a new system
     stack implementation based on alloca() that is architecture independent.
 3. Improved some malloc(size+strlen) constructs with memcpy replacing strcpy.
----August 16, 2001
 1. Fixed a bug in '+party name' that used the wrong variable to check for
     duplicate party names.
----August 18, 2001
 1. Added 'Levelup Modifiers' to the technique list. At each levelup, players'
     status will increase by the specified amount.
 2. Fixed a coloring problem with Contents: and Items: headers during a 'look'.
 3. Locked out class() and the wholist 'class' option when HIDDEN_ADMIN is set.
----August 19, 2001
 1. Fixed a bug where @teleporting someone to another room made the person who
     used @tel show up as %# instead of the player entering the room.
 2. Wimpy mode now checks for escape routes and bad conditions before forcing a
     player or enemy to escape from battle.
----August 21, 2001
 1. Fixed a bug in allowing @name to rename players to all lowercase chars.
 2. Fixed a crashing bug while showing the Answering Machine before the first
     user creates a God player character.
 3. Fix an error in displaying the full host name wrong on machines without a
     domainname set.
----August 23, 2001
 1. Fixed a bug in @clone not setting the object name if no name was specified
     on the command line.
 2. All enemies with the Aggressive condition set now behave aggressively, not
     just ones with the Monster flag set anymore.
----August 30, 2001
 1. Removed bitmaps from object data when Combat is not configured.
 2. Fixed the coloring of infravision during a 'look'.
----September 1, 2001
 1. Fixed a bug in allowing @add/deltech to specify technique number 255, which
     cannot be saved in the database.
----September 5, 2001
 1. Optimized notify() code by removing all associated tprintf()s and making
     notify() accept variable arguments. This decreases code size along with
     the added benefit of making the source a lot more readable.
----September 6, 2001
 1. Rewrote the Output Queue to store data in large buffers 8kB in size. This
     effectively reduces the number of malloc()s and free()s and drops I/O
     time from 20% to 5% for heavy-output commands, such as @find.
----September 7, 2001
 1. Merged support for Tru64 UNIX (Alpha OSF1) and SunOS back into the
     distribution.
----September 16, 2001
 1. Fixed a memory leak when destroying active sessions.

 2. Broadcast messages are no longer sent to sessions connected to services
     such as HTTP and RWHO.
----October 7, 2001
 1. Fixed a long-standing I/O bug where dead connections can cause 100% CPU
     usage due to checking an old errno when read() returns 0.
----October 19, 2001
 1. Fixed unspecified targets for using combat techniques at enemy groups.
----October 29, 2001
 1. Bitmap positions Family, Enemytype, Race, Guild, and Language now accept
     strings as input values with @bitmap.
 2. @decompile now lists @bitmap values on an object for those with POW_COMBAT.

     concentrator is connected.
----October 30, 2001
 1. Added checks for curative items and spells to not trigger when the target's
     HP/MP/EN are already full.
 2. Fixed a bug with Aggressive enemies trying to fight players in #-1 after
     they've been destroyed.
 3. Fixed a bug in fight_que taking NOTHING for a target to a normal Fight.
 4. Party leaders no longer "become the next party leaders" when defeated, if
     they are the only member of the party.
 5. Fixed a bug when objects with POW_SPOOF attempt to page players.
----November 1, 2001
 1. Fixed Stat=MAXHP from thinking it's Stat=HP on spells. Items such as the

----November 2, 2001
 1. Fixed a bug in statalias[] having only 63 entries instead of the full 64.
 2. Fixed a bug in the fight queue trying to check if an invalid enemy is alive
     when using an item while not fighting.

     procedure to make up the first 3 lines of the page header.
----November 9, 2001
 1. $Charges on spells are now applicable.
 2. Fixed percentage bugs in many HP/MAXHP and Carryweight related functions
     when values rise near MAX_INT (2147483647).

     equations on the first attack event, %4,%5,%6 for the second, and %7,%8,%9
     for the third.
 4. Advanced target selection is now coded. This allows you to do extra damage
     or miss altogether on certain types of races, families, enemies whose
     levels are multiples of some number, and so on.
----November 24, 2001
 1. Fixed a crash bug in event testing for the 'spells' and 'techs' screen.
 2. Fixed a bug in spells/techs screen displaying an empty box depending on the
     state of a player's techlist.
----November 25, 2001

 4. "Stop Entire Attack" is now the default argument for the Stop event.
----November 29, 2001

     counts something.
----December 1, 2001
 1. TinyMARE Version 1.0.8302 released.
----December 9, 2001
 1. Battle with an enemy now stops correctly when the enemy dies as a result of
     'slay'.
 2. Reworked multi-dimensional plane checking. Planes are no longer checked on
     rooms, zones, and objects that are not located in a room.
----December 10, 2001
 1. Money dropped in a room is now visible in its Items list.
----December 11, 2001
 1. Choosing a random exit (as with the 'run' command) now follows three
     distinct rules. First, it picks any random exit that is visible to the
     player. If no exit matches, then it picks any exit that would be visible
     if the room were lit. Lastly, it will pick any dark, unlocked exit.
 2. Players who see invisible things in the room can now 'look' at them too.
----December 16, 2001

 2. Queue counts for players' queue quotas are now maintained over a @reboot.
 3. Reordered flush_queue, wait_second, and halt_object such that entries are
     unlinked from the queue before any processing happens. This way in the
     event of a crash, the game will not go into an infinite loop trying to
     execute the same queue command.
 4. Loading TinyMARE v2 databases will now report when it ignores an unknown
     configuration rule saved by a different (perhaps future) version of
     TinyMARE. The database will continue to load just fine.
----January 5, 2002
 1. Combat-based object flags (Healing, Nest, Wall, etc.) are now removed from
     a non-combat implementation of TinyMARE.
----January 10, 2002
 1. Queue counts for players are now checked only after the entire database is
     loaded.
----January 12, 2002
 1. Fixed a bug in matching for objects located in a container inside of an
     XZONE room.
 2. Fixed minor problems in integrity checking during a database conversion.
 3. Moved priority for possessive-matching (i.e. 'look player's ring') below
     all other normal room matches.
----January 13, 2002
 1. @inactivity will no longer list players who have 0 for create_time (in the
     case that the database didn't store them when they were created).
 2. Fixed minor problems in '@inactivity all', including turning off infinite-
     loop detection during the process.
 3. Added environment configuration COMMAND_LOGSIZE for specifying the size
     (in lines) of the crash log for all commands recently typed into the game.
----January 14, 2002
 1. Added a 64-bit atoll() function for operating systems that don't have one.
----January 16, 2002
 1. Added "Hidden" as a flag to Levelquests to hide them from normal players.
----January 17, 2002
 1. Added support for variable-destination exits in the database. If upgrading
     to this version of Mare from a prior version, make sure the Total Objects
     listed in @st is not 254 or the database will be unable to load.
 2. Added support to the database for 32-bit spell/item numbers for the future
     installation of user-defined equipment.
 3. Modified entrances() and oexit() functions to support variable-destination
     exits. entrances() will return all exits that specify the room #dbref
     anywhere in its @vlink attribute, as long as the exit can link to it.
 4. Modified 'look' and 'exits' to allow players to see through transparent
     exits to the correct variable destination.
 5. Added a new POW_PLANE power to determine which objects can use the @plane
     command and which exits are able to shift players from one plane to
     another.
 6. Added the @vlink attribute to support variable-destination exits, including
     proper recursive checking of disconnected rooms using all available
     destinations per exit.
 7. Added variable-destination support to illusionatory exit success messages.
----January 18, 2002
 1. Added support for changing planes on an object during enter_room().
     Dropping objects in the room will set that object's plane to the player's.
 2. 'join' and 'summon' now send players to the correct destination plane, with
     a subtle warning message included.
----January 27, 2002
 1. The lockout.txt file now matches the IP Addresses of incoming connections.
 2. Rewrote init_connect() to be the main loop for resolving hostnames, locking
     out bad sites, and printing the login banner when all is well.
 3. display_textfile() no longer outputs a blank line at the end of the file.
 4. Added a new technique field for storing different money amounts in multiple
     planes of the same room.
 5. Used the 'flags' field of Item Techniques to store 16 bits of information
     about which plane the item was dropped in a room.
 6. Taking/dropping items in rooms now match items in their respective planes.
----January 28, 2002
 1. Standard game messages are now displayed only to those players whose planes
     match. Puppets in the same room as their master will relay information
     across planes.
 2. The combat system is now constrained to a single plane.
----January 29, 2002
 1. Objects moving between planes in the same room now show 'has arrived/left'
     messages.
 2. Worked around a compiler bug when working with 32-bit integer bit-shifts in
     a 64-bit arena on a 32-bit machine in convert_techtype_to_db().
----January 30, 2002
 1. Fixed a memory leak in tracking player moves when walking through exits
     that lead to the same room.
 2. Added an additional argument to lcon() and plcon() for matching objects in
     a specific plane.

 1. Players connecting from 'localhost' can now never be sitelocked.
----February 2, 2002
 1. Fixed an infinite loop while removing the internal list of conditions when
     an attack misses on condition-setting spells.
----February 5, 2002
 1. Changed the restriction on the plane() function from POW_DARK to POW_PLANE.
----February 6, 2002
 1. Fixed an overlapping call to parse_function() while checking if players in
     the room are visible based on the @weather zone attribute. Other such bugs
     may exist and will be checked thoroughly at a later date.
 2. Added new technique type 'Specialty'.
----February 15, 2002
 1. Draining HP/MP/EN from enemies no longer works if your stat is already
     full (and if it harms the enemy).
----February 18, 2002
 1. Added non-blocking user identification. This is a major improvement as each
     login will no longer hang the game. Hangs used to be as long as 4 seconds!
 2. Optimized log_main(), log_error(), log_io(), and log_resolv() by making
     these functions accept variable arguments instead of using tprintf().
----February 19, 2002
 1. Fixed displaying of long combat item names during a 'look' in the room.
 2. The game now only accepts input commands when C_RESOLVER and C_IDENT are
     turned off and the user is authenticated completely.
 3. TinyMARE now services SMTP and RWHO connections through a concentrator.
----February 26, 2002
 1. Captions are now truncated at %R characters if the object has no POW_SPOOF.
 2. The & command now behaves like TinyMUSH by also defining the attribute on
     an object if it does not already exist.
 3. Enlarged the number of arguments per event on a spell to 1000. The database
     structure was also enlarged to accompany this change.
----February 27, 2002
 1. Players now automatically have 'Beeps' turned on when they first log in
     after loading from another TinyMU* database.
----February 28, 2002
 1. Modified `+info cpu' to show major/minor page faults even if they're the
     only resources being counted on the operating system.
 2. Added the wizard command @pfile and POW_PFILE to accompany it.
----March 1, 2002
 1. Logfiles now get the full text of the log, rather than only the first 250
     characters as is shown to players on channels.
 2. Rearranged '@list powers' so that it's easier to read (one line per power)
     and restricted viewing to administrators only.
----March 5, 2002
 1. Added the template() function to get templates of Item#s over 9999.
 2. Fixed nextexp() to not return negative EXP values due to restricted
     levelquests.
 3. Added new configuration variable STARTING_CHAPTER to set the Chapter of a
     newly initialized player in combat.
----March 6, 2002
 1. Added a new command, @movespell, which moves spell numbers around in the
     database and also updates all technique lists on players/objects with
     those spell numbers to the new correct number.
 2. Rewrote death messages to accept a list of softcode-specific messages
     beyond what the game is internally coded for.
 3. Added @list deathmsgs, flipped around %0 and %1 for GameDriver/akill, and
     players will no longer see death messages for those who are in the same
     room.
----March 7, 2002
 1. Displayed the count of technique lists updated in @movespell so that
     wizards are reminded that the command does something extra special.
 2. The @input command now accepts {} around the prompt string.
----March 8, 2002
 1. Rewrote Family, Language, Leveltitle, Stat-Levelup, Race, and Guild
     structures. Values are now read from the etc/class.db textfile.
----March 10, 2002
 1. Fixed @inactivity to list players via Chapter=Prologue or Level=1 even if
     INACTIVENUKE is set to 0.
----March 12, 2002
 1. Fixed race counting during selection when there are unselectable races
     (due to gender) in the list of choices.
----March 13, 2002

----May 26, 1998
 1. @digging a room with automatic exit creation now checks if you have enough
     money to create those additional exits too.
 2. Added two new attributes, @ealias (Enter Aliases) and @lalias (Leave
     Aliases) for objects. Values contain semicolon-separated strings of
     aliases that mimic the 'enter' and 'leave' commands.
 3. Rooms can now be linked as a dropto to any other room, or *HOME*.
----May 28, 1998
 1. Rewrote the helptext index pointers to use a resizable array instead of a
     linked list.
 2. Added support for multiple error messages from the file: typo.txt.

 1. Sickness does not affect the player until the variable count reaches 2.
 2. Rewrote regeneration, swimming, and condition weakness routines.
 3. Forked database saves now send back an exit code instead of a signal to
     indicate if an error has occured.
----June 22, 1998

 2. Maximum Open Files count is now done accurately via getrlimit() instead of
     sysconf().
----June 23, 1998
 1. Completely rewrote the boolean expression lock parser code for efficiency.
----June 25, 1998
 1. New 'Wander' flag added, moving objects around once every ATIME_INTERVAL
     seconds.
----June 26, 1998
 1. Fixed minor list-checking bugs in @set and @setcond.
 2. Fixed a swimming bug that wrongly checked Mastery % to not succeed.
 3. Implemented 60 special race/relic effects, some given to a player depending
     on the race selected at creation time.
 4. Added the relics() function, which displays the effects given to a player.
 5. Moved the haspow() function from hardcode to softcode using powers().
 6. Renamed @alter_magic to @advance and fixed the bugs regarding new skills.
 7. Renamed @addmagic/@delmagic to @addtech/@deltech, and can now be used for
     any of the 15+ technique lists available on players. A technique list can
     also be accessed by word now instead of just by number.
 8. Added '@list types' to display all valid item types known by the game.
 9. New @console command, used for setting/unsetting connection flags such as
     Input, Output, and Status Bar updates.

     commands to an object or for changing the flags on a player's connection.
----July 5, 1998
 1. Added @amoon attribute, executed on every object at the moon phase change.
 2. Added @prefix and @suffix attributes for robots. These display messages
     before and after the output from each command typed in by a player.
 3. Added the @output command (used with POW_CONSOLE), which allows objects to
     send high-priority messages to connected players bypassing the gamedriver.
 4. Fixed some bugs in the HTML version of 'who' to display the @doing
     correctly, parsing the text against the owner.
 5. Made atr_parse() into a macro for greater internal efficiency.
 6. Fixed a serious bug in @defattr which let people define attributes on any
     unowned object.
 7. Coded in the @input command, which allows objects to prompt players for
     additional input, whose reply is redirected at a specific object/attribute 
     instead of the game driver.
 8. Completely removed the parse_attrib() code and rewrote @defattr, @redef,
     @undef, @trigger, @cycle, @input, get(), and v() for efficiency.
----July 6, 1998

     of the race/guild descriptions, stats, and current members of each.
----July 7, 1998
 1. Fixed a bug in the function parser that converted {} to }.
----July 31, 1998
 1. Changed the internal infinite_loop timer to a virtual profiler which counts
     the amount of time spent in an execution loop and decreated the time from
     2-minute intervals to 20 seconds.
----August 1, 1998
 1. Implemented nonblocking domain name server lookup routines for hostnames.
     This gets rid of all remaining procedures on TinyMare which lag down the
     system. In this way, a player will not be shown the login: prompt until
     his hostname is correctly resolved, but all other normal game activity
     will proceed fine.
----August 3, 1998
 1. Entered in the new +/- status modifications for races using a scale from
     1 to 9 to ensure fair balancing for each attribute.
----August 12, 1998
 1. Modified the existing experience chart to conclude level 100 at 150M exp.

 2. Added the power which goes with that command, POW_PCREATE.
 3. Added dataflags for Light and Dark intensity spells.
 4. Changed the Light flag to be accepted on any object type except player.
     Rooms set Light give an intensity so bright that players cannot see except
     with an item that emits darkness.
 5. Fixed a slight bug in @passwd <player> when entering an invalid password.
 6. Wimpy command now triggers upon HP% rather than HP value.
 7. New command, 'behavior', which sets combat tactics when encountering enemy
     groups in the wilderness.
----August 17, 1998
 1. Restricted setting droptos on rooms to Builders.
 2. Added the @flush command to clear input/output/server text buffers.
----August 18, 1998
 1. Added a check in the lock processing code to keep from referencing database
     objects that no longer exist.
----August 28, 1998

     before sending queries to the local name server.
----August 30, 1998
 1. Fixed a bug in mktm() that marked 1 year as 364 days instead of 365.

 3. Restricted the player name 'All' to be created for security reasons.
----September 5, 1998
 1. The server no longer gives random error messages for objects.
 2. Fixed a bug in the function parser when bad function names are used as
     arguments to other functions, thus blanking out the rest of the command.
 3. Concentrator logins now correctly display a user's origin hostname.
----September 6, 1998
 1. Environment variable USER_LIMIT now added for regular player login control.
 2. Various changes to the login initialization timer for session timeouts.

 2. Characters online during a reboot with a blank database or with a previous
     file where the character doesn't exist will switch to the login prompt.
 3. @trigger, @force, and #dbref now preserve the environment %# cause.
 4. New power POW_CONFIG defined for the @config command. @config is restricted
     to direct mode, allowing only some game directors to use this command.
 5. A message is displayed for any objects trying to use direct mode commands.
 6. Fixed a bug in [v(someword)] printing '0' for no apparent reason.
 7. [soul(newplayer,iscombat)] no longer crashes (due to a bitmap length of 0).

 6. 'run' and randexit() no longer choose exits hidden to the player.
 7. Added a new function, setr() which works like setq() but responds with the
     new value set to the environment register.
----January 9, 1999
 1. Extended the number of arguments allowed in functions infinitely beyond
     10 for softcode purposes. Switch() gets the most benefit from this.
 2. Hardcoded the functions neg(), dist2d(), dist3d(), rtime(), iftrue(),
     dayofyear(), season(), hasattr(), left(), right(), bnand(), s_as_with(),
     rloc(), hasflag(), haspow(), attropts(), capstr(), nearby().
 3. Modified the owner() function to find the object that a particular local
     attribute is defined on.
 4. The third argument can now be omitted in the controls() function.
 5. Softcoded $-commands defined on a universal zone now take precedence over
     any player-defined commands on a local zone or nearby object.
 6. The exits command now shows all aliases for each visible exit in the room.
 7. New fullname() function displays name + aliases when used on any exit.

     player.
11. Game commands may continue to be entered in input mode by prefixing them
     with a ! character.
12. Readded POW_FUNCTIONS for use with all functions that get database values
     and not actually examine any particular attribute string.
----January 11, 1999
 1. Added a new function ansi_strip() to remove stray ANSI escape sequences.
----January 14, 1999
 1. Modified the add(), mul(), fadd(), and fmul() functions to accept any
     number of list arguments, either space-separated or comma-separated.
 2. Added the regmatch() function to get environment variables much easier.
 3. Compatibility differences: match() now works like strmatch() in TinyMUSH,
     and wmatch() now works like match() in TinyMUSH. Match() also has
     additional boolean variable checking.
 4. Added matchall() to work with the same syntax as in TinyMUSH.
----January 15, 1999
 1. Rewrote most string functions to accept additional arguments to set list
     delimiters in processing.
 2. Finished rewriting all functions for efficiency with the new system.

     variables for the 64-bit Alpha architecture.
 2. Added the lpos() string function.
 3. Fixed bugs in all other functions for 64-bit architecture.

     are now more easily configurable in the code.
 5. Rewrote auto-deletion of player characters away from the combat system by
     judging if the last connect time is valid or set to zero. In addition,
     players whose characters are already registered will have their +laston
     time updated upon login to prevent accidental erasure.
 6. Dropping objects in other players' rooms or @forcing objects to move
     through exits into other rooms is now a function of RESTRICT_BUILDER.
 7. Added an isattr() function to accompany hasattr().
 8. Coded around a C Library error where the time() function is used with a
     year larger than 2^31-1.
 9. Reinstated the @sex attribute to set genders on non-player objects.
----January 31, 1999
 1. Fixed a bug that kept non-builders from setting locks on exits.
 2. Fixed a bug in @search that reported locations of objects that you could
     not examine properly. @search now entirely uses POW_STATS.
 3. Added Sessions and Steps display to the 'examine' command.
 4. Added variability to the INACTIVENUKE environment variable. This can be
     set to the number of days before a player should become inactive, or if
     set to 1, relies on variability on combat levels and experience. Default
     number of days is 180.
 5. Added the sessions(), steps(), and age() functions.
 6. Implemented HOURS_PER_DAY as a modifier to wtime() and now has precision to
     1 microsecond when calculating current game time.
 7. Switched object type 'Garbage' from slot 5 to 7.
 8. Implemented the randword() function in hardcode.
 9. POW_CONFIG is now required to view wizard-restricted configuration options.

 3. Fixed a bug involving @destroying objects twice with a delay specified.
----February 14, 1999
 1. Items are no longer displayed in the room when COMBAT is turned off and the
     enactor does not have POW_COMBAT.
----February 15, 1999
 1. Fixed the bug where previously existing players were automatically nuked if
     they exited the login process before registering their character.
 2. Fixed a bug in @email attribute not getting set during registration.
 3. If the game cannot save the latest database during a reboot, all players
     that have been created during that time get pushed back to the login
     screen.
----February 16, 1999
 1. Fixed off-by-1 problems in @empower, haspow(), and controls(). Powerlists
     now start with the value 0 instead of 1.
 2. Players reconnecting to the game through a different connection now retain
     their position on the wholist as well as total online time.
 3. Fixed a bug in the RECONNECT command where it does not reset your online
     time until you connect as a valid character.
 4. RECONNECT correctly disables output from the screen during login process.
 5. Types and Classes in '+db database' now respect different names and numbers
     for defined classes.
 6. The ' character can be used to direct a message to another player through
     the +com system now.
 7. The Autosave..! message now only appears if DB_FORK is set to 0 to warn
     players that the game will be halted for a few seconds to save the
     database file.
 8. RESTRICT_BUILD and RESTRICT_TELEPORT environment variables are cancelled
     when a player is set with the Builder flag. Builder is no longer implied
     by POW_FREE, but instead correctly by POW_BUILD.
 9. New zone flag Restrict for restricting players from being able to lock or
     unlock exits in a particular zone. Builders can bypass this restriction.
----February 17, 1999
 1. Fixed a bug in the @town command removing defined towns from the database.
----February 20, 1999
 1. Fixed a bug in running an infinite amount of nested @switch, @redirect,
     @time, @iterate, or instant-force commands, overflowing the stack.
 2. Added malloc accounting information to the display in +db cpu.
 3. The function upfront() now returns the #dbref of the next created object.
----February 24, 1999
 1. New support for embedded ANSI color and default colors stored in the @color
     attribute. Accepts both numerical color values and case-sensitive letter
     combinations to determine color for night, day, and multiple seasons.
 2. Added the public ansi() function which replaces the old rainbow() function.
 3. Fixed several bugs in routines that used unparse_object() and did not have
     enough buffer space for long object names with a rainbow color.
----February 25, 1999
 1. Added additive ansi color %-substitutions %x?, where ? is the color flag to
     add, and %|...|, where ... is any number of flags for the following text.
     The %| substitution may contain numbers and is processed just like the
     @color attribute, only the currently existing color is first applied. A
     %xn sequence returns text back to normal color.
----February 27, 1999
 1. Fixed a crash problem in @nuking connected players with the new data field.
----March 1, 1999

 4. Typing 'look here' won't show AF_OSEE attributes unless you own the room.
----March 5, 1999
 1. Added a function netstat() to display internal runtime statistics from
     global variables saved over @reboots.
 2. Coded in a new control command, @while, which works like @switch but
     executes the @while command over until no expression match is found.
----March 7, 1999
 1. Reconnecting to the game now preserves your position on the who list.
 2. Another database format change to support 16 +config options and to allow
     money values stored on rooms and some objects.
----March 19, 1999
 1. Implemented the +term wordwrap option for server-side wrapping. This choice
     is automatically set on new character registrations who use telnet instead
     of tinyfugue to access the game.
----March 20, 1999
 1. Added the insert() function.
 2. Coded in new ^-event constructs for command-matching on objects. Example:
     @va great book=^read:@pemit %#=You flip through the pages of the book.
     >> read book
 3. In a restricted zone, players can now only go through exits that have a
     return exit pointing back to the source room.
----March 21, 1999
 1. Added LOGINS and DBSAVE to the list of variables in netstat(). Removed the
     hardcoded 'epoch' and 'newconc' global variables that they replaced.
----March 23, 1999
 1. Added genders to objects through the @sex attribute by the first letter,
     which can be M, F, W, or P, indicating Male, Female, or Plural, and Neuter
     if anything else is specified.
 2. Added the gender(), subj(), objn(), poss(), and aposs() functions to do a
     %s, %o, %p, and %a substitution on a specific object respectively.
 3. Added CONNECTS to the list of netstat variables to log the number of
     successful connections. Renamed the variable FCONNECT to FAILED.
----March 25, 1999
 1. Fixed a major crash bug in the @halt command when used on objects.
 2. Fixed several bugs in loading player-only attributes from a MUSE-style
     database.
 3. Rewrote @destroy and @purge to use a new free-list structure that speeds up
     object recycling at database load by a landslide. This is very useful for
     databases with thousands of destroyed objects.
----March 26, 1999
 1. Shrunk the output of +db cpu down to print only fields with valid values.
 2. Fixed a number of configuration bugs in porting to other operating systems.
----April 1, 1999

----April 11, 1999
 1. @notify unidle players now prints the amount of time they've been idle.
 2. Added support for any number of game sockets, services, HTML ports, and
     domain name service connections via the descriptor list.
 3. @ctrace now displays status of all used file descriptors in a colored
     hierarchy, showing sockets, services, and players.

 1. Fixed a bug that displays all logfile text to everyone online if nobody has
     entered a command into the game since the last reboot.
 2. Added support for multiple login ports via the configuration file
     'run/etc/portmap'. Three types of ports added: Game port for all users to
     connect to, an Admin port for administrators only, and a Web Server port
     for viewing HTML documents sent by the server itself. The branch here is
     to later enable ports with a separate list of file descriptors for
     communicating with the game server in multiple threads of execution.
----May 13, 1999
 1. Added support for a fourth type of port, 'mesg', to display a quick message
     to the screen and disconnect the user whenever a player telnets to a port.
----May 16, 1999
 1. #0 is no longer ever reported as a disconnected room, even if PLAYER_START
     is set to something else.
----May 20, 1999
 1. Fixed a bug in legally setting a few flags, most commonly Dark, on objects
     and getting back the message saying "Permission denied."
----May 21, 1999
 1. Action response messages, normally sent only if an object is set Quiet, are
     now only sent to either players or objects who are set Puppet and !Quiet.

     (%#) if and only if the cause is in the same room as the enactor.
 3. @upfront is no longer restricted to players with POW_DB.
 4. Rewrote command parsing to accept {} around 1-Argument commands.
----May 22, 1999
 1. File reading routines now correctly parse texts written in MS-DOS. This
     also fixes load errors with TinyMUSE databases in Windows.
 2. Changed the @atime structure to trigger standard guard resurrection and
     automatic object moving (Wander flag) to operate on only a fraction of
     objects per minute.
 3. New @config variables RESURRECT_LOOP and WANDER_LOOP for the maximum time
     delay (minutes) between two consecutive loops for the same object number.
 4. It is now possible to @trigger attributes that have !, $, or ^ Events
     embedded onto them. The triggering just skips the event and a possible
     /Lock/ and begins at the first command it finds.
 5. Fixed a bug in @oemit %# and spoofing the player's name in the message.

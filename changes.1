 1. NetMARE Exeception Handling Code ALPHA 1.
     All fatal errors (those which normally crash the game) return control to
     game driver, and the game continues as if the command was never pressed.
     Sigmentation Fault errors check the database for inconsistencies before
     continuing. If an inconsistency is found during the check or if the game
     crashes twice before the next command is pressed, the process will abort.

     Runtime crashes are logged with the player who typed in the fatal command.
     Login processes are prepended with Connection ID# for trace purposes.
     Currently there is no check against database objectlist errors.

     Future changes of this code may allow the database to save and the game
     to reboot every time netmare receives a Segmentation Fault signal from
     the processor. Currently, control is given back to the game driver with
     hopes that it was only the command that caused this problem.

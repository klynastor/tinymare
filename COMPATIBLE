TinyMARE v1.0 Compatibility Issues - Last update 2000-09-29


This alpha release version of TinyMare v1.0 is intended as a drop-in bugfix
replacement/enhancement of TinyMuse. Since the entire source code distribution
has been rewritten from scratch, there are several compatibility issues between
the two servers that might result in strange behavior of softcoded objects.
This file attempts to list the problems during old database conversion.


This version of TinyMARE can load the following database formats:

 TinyMush v10
 TinyMuse v1-v3
 TinyMuse Zoned v3-v15
 TinyMare Compressed RAM v1
 TinyMush-3 v1


Conversion notes specific to database type:

TinyMUSE:
---------
Several hardcoded functions used in MUSE have been renamed to fit a standard.
While most can be rewritten using @defattr functions, players are urged to
recode their objects to instead use those provided by the system.

The following is a list of MUSE functions that are no longer supported
internally by TinyMare, each with replacement softcode for a Universal Zone:

   string(): [repeat(v(0),v(1))]
  wchange(): [replace(v(0),v(1),v(2))]

The @aahear and @amhear attributes were removed. @ahear now acts like @aahear,
which might cause infinite queue loops on some objects set Listen:* unless it
is also set Quiet.

The @force and @trigger commands now preserve the %# environment variable as
the cause of the original object who instantiated the command. This enables the
following code to work properly:

  @va object=$menu:@pemit %#=You look at the menu.;@wait 3=@tr me/vb
  @vb object=@pemit %#=Much to your misfortune, you find no items available.

The @switch command instantly executes commands without entering them into
the queue. In MUSE, @switch cannot be used in softcode that carries a large
time constraint with other queue commands ready for execution.

Forcing an object via use of the # symbol completely bypasses the queue system.
This is also a good way to execute immediate single commands on Haven objects,
since the original object is the one queueing the command. Example:

  > @create Puppet
    Puppet(#58) created.
  > #58 say Hey there!

Ansi colors using the || pattern in attributes are prefixed with a % to retain
compatibility with the function parser. Some versions of MUSE handle color
codes differently. Mare tries to auto-detect this and compensates for the
differences by altering what's inside the ||'s. Anything it cannot detect is
left untouched.

The zone() function prints the same output as lzone() in MUSE.


TinyMUSH:
---------
- Vector functions are not implemented.
- @waited semaphores are not implemented.
- There is no @dolist command.
- @iter and @foreach do not recognize the ## token.


Known Bugs:
-----------
- Building restrictions for RESTRICT_TELEPORT do not yet follow the rules
  outlined in the Helptext documentation. The Helptext is correct, and the code
  will be fixed in a future version of TinyMARE.
- Automatic database backups using @config DB_BACKUP and DB_EPOCH are not yet
  implemented.

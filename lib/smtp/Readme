  TINYMARE SMTP SUPPORT  (TinyMare Mail System Version 2.2)

This text describes how to set up your 'sendmail' mailer to accept mail for
your mud! To begin, you need a copy of the latest sendmail source (8.10.1
at the time of this writing), available at the following URL:

  ftp://ftp.sendmail.org/pub/sendmail

If all you want to do is send outgoing email instead of receive email, then
run these TinyMare commands, replacing the email address with your own:

  @config email_address=windsmare.winds.org
  @config mailhost=localhost


1. Compiling the sendmail.cf file
---------------------------------

First unpack the sendmail source tarball in a temporary directory. You can do
this by typing the following commands (replacing the version number with the
correct one you have).

  cd /tmp
  tar -xzvvf sendmail-8.10.1.tar.gz

Make a backup of your current sendmail.cf file. For sendmail versions 8.10
and later, this file will be located in /etc/mail/sendmail.cf. Versions
prior to 8.10 will be found in /etc/sendmail.cf.

  cp /etc/mail/sendmail.cf /etc/mail/sendmail.cf.preserve

Copy the .mc and .m4 files into the appropriate configuration sections of your
sendmail source. The file 'tinymare.mc' should be put into the cf/cf directory,
and the file 'winds.m4' should be placed into the cf/mailer directory.

  cp tinymare.mc /tmp/sendmail-8.10.1/cf/cf
  cp winds.m4 /tmp/sendmail-8.10.1/cf/mailer

Edit the tinymare.mc file in the cf/cf directory. This file was written
assuming you run a standard version of Linux, and is NOT customized for any
particular distribution. If you are not running Linux, chances are you can 
find a generic .mc file in that same directory to use that matches your
operating system type. Copy that file to 'tinymare.mc' in the same directory.
line:  MAILER(mudname)  Replacing 'mudname' with the name of your mud.

If you ARE running Linux, chances are your distribution already has a special
sendmail.mc file hand-crafted for your system. This can usually be found in
/etc/sendmail.mc or in the source of your sendmail package. For example, the
redhat sendmail SRPM uses the file 'sendmail-redhat.mc'.

Append the following line to the end of your 'tinymare.mc' file, replacing the
word 'mudname' with the name of your mud (without the MARE suffix):

  MAILER(mudname)

Next, cd into the sendmail-8.10.1/cf/mailer directory and replace the name of
the 'winds.m4' file with the name you chose in the MAILER line:

  cd /tmp/sendmail-8.10.1/cf/mailer
  mv winds.m4 mudname.m4

By specifing your mudname in these files, you can have sendmail handle mail
for multiple muds. All you need to do is add a MAILER() directive for each mud
in your tinymare.mc file!

Next, edit your 'mudname.m4' file. This might be the hardest step to follow.
The default file that comes with TinyMare was hand-crafted for the mud that
runs on winds.org port 7348. It listens for mail that gets sent to the address
user@windsmare.winds.org, and the MAILER(winds) directive was used in the .mc
file.

First, change the word 'winds' in the Mwinds, and $#winds lines to the new
mudname you entered as the name of the .m4 file. These two lines must match
or the redirection will fail (sendmail will not start up).

Next, change the 'redir winds.org' line to the name of the host that your mud
resides on. This should not be 'redir localhost', for reasons explained below.

Now, change all occurances of 'windsmare.winds.org' to an address that you
want people to send email to. Be careful--if this address is the same name as
your host, then all mail sent to your host will be redirected to the mud!
You'll want to make sure this new email address is fully resolvable, and is
pointing to your host. This means adding an entry to the /etc/hosts file and
to your DNS records (see your BIND/NAMED manual for details).

You want to make sure this email address (the one you replaced
'windsmare.winds.org' with) is fully resolvable, and is pointing to your host.
This means adding an entry for your new email host to the /etc/hosts file and
to your DNS records (see your BIND manual for details). Note that your new
email address can Not be a canonical name for your host. Doing this will force
external mailers to use your original hostname instead of the new one.

Warning: The winds.m4 file has tabs in certain locations after the R$+ ruleset.
Sendmail will fail to run if these tabs are removed or replaced with spaces.
Also be careful: a . must follow the hostname in the < > in the R$+ rule.

Run this command to generate the sendmail.cf file and place it into /etc/mail:

  m4 ../m4/cf.m4 tinymare.mc > /etc/mail/sendmail.cf

If there are no errors, then all has gone well so far.


2. Compile sendmail and the redir program
-----------------------------------------

This is an easy step. Depending on your operating system, this command should
be all you need to compile and install sendmail:

  cd /tmp/sendmail-8.10.1
  ./Build
  ./Build install

The utility program, 'redir', must now also be compiled at this point. You'll
find this program in the 'mare/src/util' directory of the TinyMare source tree.
You can compile it using 'make redir', then copy it to /usr/local/bin. You can
copy it to a different directory as long as you change the path to 'redir' in
the 'winds.m4' mailer file mentioned in Section 1.

Test redir. Try 'redir localhost 7348'. If you get a login prompt to your mud,
then it works.

Restart sendmail. For RedHat Linux users, try the following commands:

  /etc/rc.d/init.d/sendmail stop
  /etc/rc.d/init.d/sendmail start

For others, this should suffice:

  killall -15 sendmail
  /usr/sbin/sendmail -bd -q15m


3. Install mud-specific configuration files
-------------------------------------------

The file you referenced in your 'winds.m4' mailer file, (by default
/usr/local/etc/windsmare.smtp), must contain two lines:

SMTP
password

The password is any 5-8 character password you want for this service, and
must be duplicated verbatim into the 'run/etc/services' file off of your
TinyMare source tree. The 'services' file should contain a line that looks
like this to enable SMTP support:

smtp	winds.org	password

Note: 'winds.org' is the name of your host, and not 'localhost'. These two
are very different things, and generate two different IP addresses. You CAN
use 'localhost' if you also change the 'redir' command in 'winds.m4' to use
localhost as well.


4. Give it a test run
---------------------

Send some email to <your character name>@<your new mud email address>, such
as: gandalf@windsmare.winds.org  If everything goes well, you should see
something like the following on the game:

[_log_io] Login 24: root@winds.org. desc->7
[_log_io] Email Handler 24: root@winds.org. desc->7
[_log_io] SMTP: Incoming Mail (4 bytes); From <gandalf@winds.org>, To: Gandalf
You sense that you have new mail, message 123, from gandalf@winds.org.
[_log_io] Logout 24: root@winds.org. desc->7

If you get a 'Login failed: SMTP', then you do not have your 'run/etc/services'
file configured for the correct hostname or correct password under the smtp
entry.

If you get no login at all, then one of several things might be wrong. Is the
path to 'redir' correct in the 'winds.m4' file? Did you make sure to include
MAILER(winds) in your tinymare.mc file? Here's how to check.

Edit your /etc/mail/sendmail.cf file and search for your email host R$+ ruleset
that looks like the following:

R$+ < @ windsmare.winds.org. >	$#winds $@ windsmare.winds.org $: $1

Comment that out with a #, and replace it with this (TAB BEFORE THE $#error):

R$+ < @ windsmare.winds.org. >	$#error $@ 5.1.3 $: "553 No ruleset specified"

Then telnet to localhost 25, and type in the following commands:

  HELO your.hostname.com
  MAIL FROM: username@your.hostname.com
  RCPT TO: mudcharacter@chosen.mud.address.com

If this reports a '553' error, then there is a problem with your 'redir'
command. If it doesn't, then you most likely have a redirection problem or you
did not include the appropriate features listed in the default 'tinymare.mc'
or 'winds.m4' files. Be sure that near the top of your sendmail.cf, there are
two lines that begin with CP and CR that list your mud email address.
Redirection won't work at all if these two lines are not there.

To test redirection, try telnetting to port 25 from a remote site and replace
your.hostname.com with the hostname of the remote site. Sometimes sendmail will
allow redirection for local hosts and not remote hosts. If you get a
'relaying denied' message here, then you need to apply the following line to
tinymare.mc, rebuild the sendmail.cf file, and restart sendmail:

  FEATURE(relay_entire_domain)


5. Closing remarks
------------------

If this procedure does not work for your UNIX system, and you have the latest
version of sendmail, email me and we'll see if we can get something working
for you. If you happen to come up with a different method to handle incoming
mail under a different UNIX system, or a different mailer, I'd like to include
the method in the TinyMare distribution.

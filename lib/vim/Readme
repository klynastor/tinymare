  TinyMare Vim Syntax Files

The .vim files in this directory can replace the syntax-hiliting files 'vim'
uses for your system. The files are documented as follows:

  c.vim:

A replacement version of the C syntax hiliting file by Bram Moolenaar. This
version fixes the possible %-substitution formats in printf-style strings and
adds several of the widely used constants (NOTHING, GOD, HOME, etc.) and type
specifications (DESC, ATRDEF, hash, etc.) that are in use in this code
distribution.

For installation, simply copy this c.vim file into the correct syntax/
directory in vim's shared directory tree. For instance, with Vim 6.0, type the
following:

# cp c.vim /usr/share/vim/vim60/syntax/c.vim


  mare.vim:

This file contains the correct syntax hiliting for the 'helptext.txt' file in
the run/msgs directory of TinyMare. This syntax file will allow you to edit the
helptext with the same color scheme as it would appear if the player typed
'help' in the game.

For installation, simply copy this mare.vim file into the correct syntax/
directory in vim's shared directory tree. For instance, with Vim 6.0, type the
following:

# cp mare.vim /usr/share/vim/vim60/syntax/mare.vim


The files in this TinyMare archive are best viewed under an 80-column screen.

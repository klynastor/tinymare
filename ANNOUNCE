Annoucement for TinyMARE v1.0:
------------------------------

TinyMARE (Multi-user Adventure Roleplaying Epic) is a text-based MUD server
completely rewritten for efficiency using TinyMUSH and TinyMUSE as a basis for
its game engine. The server is designed for creating an extensive, novelistic
role-playing atmosphere supporting real-time combat, night/day, seasons, and
global weather. Using your favorite telnet client, it lets players log on to
explore your virtual world, find helpful items, learn skills and techniques,
and form parties with others to defeat obstacles you create in your own epic
adventure.

In terms of administratability, MARE utilizes the latest features in the C
Library for background hostname lookup and user authentication. It supports a
built-in HTML server, multiple telnet ports, concentrator service for up to
65,000 simuletaneous connections, and scalability for interfacing with other
MAREs on the internet. Still at a developmental stage, MARE is considered to be
one of the most efficient game servers, clocked at handling over 1,250 users
online without lag using a 133MHz Pentium.

The current version includes routines for starting a new database or converting
from a previous existing TinyMUSE database. Online coding supports nearly all
of the functionality of MUSH and MUSE combined, plus new programming styles and
features unique to this server. Tested to compile successfully on Linux, SunOS,
SysV, and OSF1 UNIX workstations. Also compiles cleanly on Windows 95/98/NT.
